# MyProject
This project revolves around a website offering three options: a fully developed and tested Register Form, along with ongoing projects - a Subscription feature and a Driving Permission module. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site ensures a dynamic and interactive user experience. Presently, all features are optimized for full-screen use, enhancing usability and interface clarity.
